    "A **word embedding** $W: \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a parametric function that maps a word type to a high-dimensional vector. Typically, the function is a simple lookup table parameterized by a matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, with a new row for each word type; the query $W(i)$ will return the $i$th row of $\\mathbf{W}$. As usual in the machine learning paradigm, $\\mathbf{W}$ is initialized randomly, and trained to produce small cost under some objective function.\n",

    "**What's the motivation for using word embeddings?** We have seen that image processing systems work with complex data encoded as vectors of pixel intensities. On the other hand, traditional NLP systems used to treat words as symbolic tokens. These symbols are arbitrary, and don't provide information about the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols.\n",

    "In classic neural probabilistic  language models (and in tutorial), we use a maximum likelihood criterion to estimate the parameters of a model that computes a vector representation $u_i$ for a word $w_i$ as well as a contextual representation $v_j$ for a history $h_j$ (which could simply be the representation of the preceding word in a unigram model, or a more complex summary of the context). We assume a multinomial distribution over $w_i$, and thus the likelihood objective is a softmax function:\n",

Luckily, we can use a method called *noise-contrastive estimation* (NCE) so that we needn't use the full probabilistic model as above, but instead use a binary classification objective. The insight is to try to discriminate the target word $w_i$ from randomly sampled *noise* words $\\tilde{w} \\sim p_\\text{noise}(w)$. The noise distribution $p_\\text{noise}(w)$ is often chosen to be the uniform distribution over all words in the vocabulary.\n",

In practice, word embedding training procedures use a slightly modified version of the NCE objective, called *negative sampling* (NS), introduced in [3], in which samples from the noise distribution are strictly *negative* examples (i.e., not $w_i$). Consider the NS objective for a single word-context $w_i$-$h_j$ pair:\n",

    "**Pretrained word embeddings** are word embeddings that have already been constructed in advance using some (usually task-agnostic) training procedure. The advantage of using off-the-shelf, pretrained word embeddings is that they are computationally simple to use (since no fine-tuning is required). The downside is that they may not be the best for the task we wish to apply them to. We can therefore evaluate the quality of pretrained embeddings by applying them to a specific downstream task such finding the word that is most similar to a given word, or analogical reasoning. The distance (Euclidean or cosine) between two word embeddings should measure the linguistic or semantic similarity of the corresponding words.\n",
